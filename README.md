### - Improving jet clustering using different unsupervised learning algorithms - 
Authors: Harinder Singh Bawa(https://github.com/hbawa120578). 


The different clustering algorithms are currently stored in files named `<algorithm>.py`. 
These rely on data that is generated either through scikit-learn's `make_blobs` or our generator in the JetGenerator folder. The `read_data` module can be used to interface with the `.txt` files in the JetGenerator folder.
